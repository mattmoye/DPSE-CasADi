# Neuronal Data Assimilation (neuroDA)
This is an implementation of dynamical state and parameter estimation using the CasADi framework for setting up the sparse optimization problem.
Particularly, we utilize a variational data assimilation techinque with a control term to "nudge" the data towards the observations.

This software, implemented in MATLAB, builds upon CasADi, which can be installed from https://web.casadi.org/get/ . No additional toolboxes are necessary, and all solutions are found using the default installed optimizer, MUMPS. For users with particularly large/ sparse problems, the suggested software repository, which utilizes a colpack driver for coloring the hessian, can be obtained from https://github.com/casadi/binaries/releases/tag/commit-09ad006. If the specific configuration is not available, please create an issue and I will try to contract the CasaADi devs. 

Running the main_example_Rhabdomys.m script will produce figures and illustrate how to run the code for a specified model. More details are given in the rhabdomys_neuroDAguide.pdf document.
