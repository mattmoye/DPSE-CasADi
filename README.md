# DSPE-CasADi
This is an implementation of dynamical state and parameter estimation using the CasADi framework for setting up the sparse optimization problem.

This software, implemented in MATLAB, builds upon CasADi, which can be installed from https://web.casadi.org/get/ . No additional toolboxes are necessary, and all solutions are found using the default installed optimizer, MUMPS. For users with particularly large/ sparse problems, the suggested software repository, which utilizes a colpack driver for coloring the hessian, can be obtained from https://github.com/casadi/binaries/releases/tag/commit-09ad006. If the specific configuration is not available, please create an issue and I will try to contract the CasaADi devs.
